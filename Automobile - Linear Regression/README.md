Automobile - Linear Regression

Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and
producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. They want to understand the factors on 
which the pricing of a car depends. 

Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American marketing, since those may 
be very different from the Chinese market. 

As part of this case study used the market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different 
types of cars across the Americal market. 

As part of the activity a linear model is built to identify the price of cars with the available independent variables. 
It will be used to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables and manipulate the design of the cars,
the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels.
