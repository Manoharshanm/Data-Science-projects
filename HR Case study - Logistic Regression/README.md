HR case study - Logistic Regression

Problem Statement:

A large company employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year around 15% of its employees 
leave and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of 
attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company.

Goal of the case study:

Built a logistic regression model to indentify the factors contributing to the attrituon. The company wants to understand the factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want 
to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. 

Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.
