HR case study - Logistic Regression

Problem Statement:

A large company employs around 4000 employees. However, every year around 15% of its employees leave and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company.

Goal of the case study:

Built a logistic regression model to indentify the factors contributing to the attrituon and to understand the factors the company should focus on in order to curb attrition. Present the variables which are most important and needs to be addressed right away.
