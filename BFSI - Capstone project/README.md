BFSI - Capstone Project

A leading credit card provider that gets thousands of credit card applicants every year. But in the past few years, it has
experienced an increase in credit loss. They believe that the best strategy to mitigate credit risk is to ‘acquire the right 
customers’.


In this project, we will help the company identify the right customers using predictive models. Using past data of the bank’s 
applicants to determine the factors affecting credit risk, create strategies to mitigate the acquisition risk and assess 
the financial benefit of your project.   

Following models are built in the exercise:
1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest
