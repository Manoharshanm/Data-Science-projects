Handwritten Digit Recognition using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Problem Statement:
A classic problem in the field of pattern recognition is that of handwritten digit recognition. Suppose that we have an image of a digit submitted by a user via a scanner, a tablet, or other digital devices. The goal is to develop a model that can correctly identify the digit (between 0-9) written in an image. 

Solution:

Developed a model model using Support Vector Machine which correctly classify the handwritten digits based on the pixel values given as features.

Note: The Cross validation function in SVM requires high processing power. Hence parallel proceessing is done to enable the computation to be faster.
